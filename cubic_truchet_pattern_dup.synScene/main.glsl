	Cubic Truchet Pattern
	---------------------

	I have a more elaborate 3D Truchet related example to post, but wanted to put up a
	simpler version first. There are a few cubic Truchet examples on here, including one
	of my own, so I'm not bringing anything particularly new to the table. :)

	I like 3D cubic Truchet patterns, because they're geometrically interesting, and are
	reasonably easy to produce. A standard 3D Truchet tile consists of three toroids
	centered on three edges of a cube, positioned to enter and exit six cube faces... Look
	one up on the internet, and that diatribe should make more sense. :) The idea is to
	interconnect the tiles in a 3D grid - by randomly rotating each around one of the axes -
	to produce an interesting spaghetti looking pattern.

	Constructing the individual tiles is as simple as breaking space into a cubic grid then
	positioning three torii in each cell. If you can position, rotate and render a torus,
	then it should be rudimentary.

	Detailed scenes look cool, but sometimes it can be difficult to separate the main point
	of the code from the details themselves. The Truchet code requires but a few lines.
	Adding a few decorations complicates things slightly, and trying to do it in a more
	efficient way can confuse things even further. I've tried my best to mitigate this.
    However, you'll see some esoteric object ID code scattered throughout the example, which
	consists of last minute logic that I put together to get the job done... You can safely
	ignore it. :)

	I code most things on a fast computer these days, which doesn't exactly help when it
	comes to optimization. As a rough guage, I'll try to get it running as smoothly as
	possible in fullscreen. This one seems to run OK in fullscreen, but it could do with
	a few extra tweaks. Aesthetically speaking, I had the 800 by 450 canvas in mind.

	I'm not really sure what kind of look I was going for, but I wanted something simple
	and clean looking that clearly showed the Truchet pattern. The lighting is very basic,
	but reasonably effective.

	Anyway, I'll put up my more interesting example next... provided I don't get
	sidetracked. :)

    into a circle first:

	float torus(vec3 p, vec3 center){

	    // Position the torus.
